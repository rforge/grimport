\section{Changes in version 0.1-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fix to path parsing to handle path data of the form
    \code{d="M x y"} (by ignoring such paths).

    \item Bug fix for converting SVG style to gpar settings
    when style is a url() reference (it was doing the wrong thing
    to replace, for example, \code{gp$fill} with
    \code{gp$gradientFill} and could end up with neither).
  }
}
\section{Changes in version 0.1-0}{
  \itemize{

    \item Initial release. Intended to import SVG images generated by
    the 'grConvert' package.

    \item Now using SVG instead of PostScript, allowing us to support
    many more graphical features.

  }
