Description: Functions for importing external vector images and
  drawing them as part of R plots.  This package is different from the
  'grImport' package because, where that package imports 'PostScript'
  format images, this package imports 'SVG' format images.  Furthermore,
  this package imports a specific subset of 'SVG', so external images
  must be pre-processed using a package like 'rsvg' to produce 'SVG'
  that this package can import.  'SVG' features that are not supported
  by R graphics, e.g., gradient fills, can be imported and then
  exported via the 'gridSVG' package.
