Installation Instructions
=========================

In order to correctly read in all of the currently supported vector
image formats, it is necessary to have the development header files
and the required libraries. In Debian (and probably Ubuntu and
friends) the following command (as root) should install the required
files:

apt-get install libcairo2-dev libspectre-dev librsvg2-dev \
                libpoppler-glib-dev

However, it is not strictly necessary to have all of these packages
installed. For example, if you do not wish to have PostScript as a
supported input format, it is possible to simply omit
`libspectre-dev`. Similarly for SVG and PDF, omit `librsvg2-dev` and
`libpoppler-glib-dev` respectively.

It is also possible to disable support for a given input format when
installing the package even when the platform supports that
format. This is possible via a `--configure-args` argument when
installing a package. There are three possible arguments:

* `--disable-ps-input`: Disable support for PostScript as an input
  format.
* `--disable-pdf-input`: Disable support for PDF as an input format.
* `--disable-svg-input`: Disable support for SVG as an input format.

To explicitly disable support for an input format in practice would
involve installing the grConvert package like so:

# Disabling support for PS and PDF input:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--disable-ps-input --disable-pdf-input" \
  grConvert_0.1-0.tar.gz
# Disabling only PS
R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--disable-ps-input" grConvert_0.1-0.tar.gz

Similarly, we can apply the same `configure` arugments via the
`install.packages()` function.

install.packages("grConvert_0.1-0.tar.gz", type = "source", repos = NULL,
                 configure.args = "--disable-ps-input")

Note that if all three formats are disabled, then installation will
not proceed because the `grConvert` package cannot convert images if
it cannot parse any of them.
